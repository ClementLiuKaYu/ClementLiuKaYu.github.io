1.  Page design and features:
    Mobile responsive.
    Navigation bar with smooth scroll.
    Landing pages using scroll snap.
    Video background for main page and contact page.
    Contact page formspree.

2.  Things that I will change/implement later:
    A photo on the main page.
    The overall design, colors and layout don't look good together.
    Projects and links to their github pages.
    A different approach to mobile responsiveness.

3.  Libraries I used:
    Used Fontawesome for icons.
    I didn't use any library.
    I was going to use a few libraries but they seem to conflict with each other.
